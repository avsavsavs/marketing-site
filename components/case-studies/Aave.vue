              Aave launched their 80/20 AAVE/ETH Safety Incentive pool on
              Balancer, allowing LPs to help secure their protocol while earning
              rewards in both AAVE and BAL.

            <li>
              Aave is also building the first Balancer V2 Asset Manager—allowing
              idle assets in Balancer V2 pools to earn yield on Aave. This
              partnership brings more capital efficiency to LPs who earn
              additional fees on top of swap fees and BAL from liquidity mining.

            “Part of what makes DeFi so exciting is its composability, and with
            Balancer this has resulted in a partnership that optimises the
            experience for liquidity providers through the Aave-Balancer Asset
            Manager and opens up new possibilities for Aave stakers with the
            AAVE/ETH Safety Incentive pool. We look forward to exploring more
            synergies with Balancer in the future.”
