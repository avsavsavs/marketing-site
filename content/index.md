    description1: Aave launched their 80/20 AAVE/ETH Safety Incentive pool on Balancer, allowing LPs to help secure their protocol while earning rewards in both AAVE and BAL.
    description2: Aave is also building the first Balancer V2 Asset Manager—allowing idle assets in Balancer V2 pools to earn yield on Aave. This partnership brings more capital efficiency to LPs who earn additional fees on top of swap fees and BAL from liquidity mining.
    quote: “Part of what makes DeFi so exciting is its composability, and with Balancer this has resulted in a partnership that optimises the experience for liquidity providers through the Aave-Balancer Asset Manager and opens up new possibilities for Aave stakers with the AAVE/ETH Safety Incentive pool. We look forward to exploring more synergies with Balancer in the future.”
