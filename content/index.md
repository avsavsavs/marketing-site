    description1: Aave launched their 80/20 AAVE/ETH Safety Incentive pool on Balancer, allowing 
            LPs to help secure their protocol while earning rewards in both AAVE and BAL.
    description2: Aave is also building the first Balancer V2 Asset Manager—allowing idle assets 
            in Balancer V2 pools to earn yield on Aave. This partnership brings more capital efficiency 
            to LPs who earn additional fees on top of swap fees and BAL from liquidity mining.
    quote: “Part of what makes DeFi so exciting is its composability, and with Balancer this has 
            resulted in a partnership that optimises the experience for liquidity providers through the 
            Aave-Balancer Asset Manager and opens up new possibilities for Aave stakers with the 
            AAVE/ETH Safety Incentive pool. We look forward to exploring more synergies with Balancer in the future.”

        quote: The most informed see the writing on the wall for how integral Balancer is becoming 
                to DeFi liquidity. It is beloved by builders for allowing them to build a vast array of liquidity 
                pools to solve pressing problems. Over time, it will find itself at the center of more & more 
                pivotal liquidity experiments.
