## How it uses Balancer protocol

The Balancer App was the original proof-of-concept built on the Balancer Protocol technology. It showcases all the current major Balancer protocol smart contracts and displays pools from across the ecosystem. The Balancer App currently supports Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon and Arbitrum.

The code is open-source and available for anyone to inspect on [Github](https://github.com/balancer-labs/). Anyone in the world can fork the repo and propose improvements to the code. Alternatively, anyone can fork the code and create their own UI with their own preferences.

The App also serves as a good reference point for developers looking to build on Balancer who want practical examples of how to interact with the smart contracts.
