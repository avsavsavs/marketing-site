## About

CoW Protocol matches trades via batch auctions for a variety of on-chain liquidity sources.
Trades can be settled via underlying on-chain AMMs directly or via DEX Aggregators, depending on which pool/path offers the best price. It is thus essentially acting as a DEX Aggregator of the DEX Aggregators.

In addition, before finding the best price for a trade from available on-chain liquidity, CoW Protocol first seeks a coincidence of wants within the existing batch to offer an even better price than any pool can.

## How it uses Balancer protocol

The CoW Protocol leverages the gas efficiency of Balancer V2 multi-hop swaps to give users the best price and execution possible along with with MEV protection.

The Balancer CoW Protocol is a trade interface that uses CoW Solvers tightly integrated with the Balancer Vault to execute trades in batches. Using CoW Solvers, traders submit their swaps by simply signing a message to send a gasless trade. The solvers then prioritize matching the various trades to take advantage of any possible Coincidence of Wants) before settling the remaining trades using on-chain liquidity, which allows the solvers to protect traders for Miner Extractable Value (MEV).

”The collaboration with Balancer is a natural fit, the native integration of Balancer’s V2 architecture allows us to achieve even better prices for the end-users and provide a smooth UX across the two platforms. It’s an important milestone towards our mission to build an infrastructure layer that protects traders.”
