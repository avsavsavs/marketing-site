## About

Xave Finance (pronounced “Save Finance”) aims to enable financial services companies (such as “fintechs” and neobanks) to leverage DeFi for actual use cases, such as real time remittance transfers and high yield consumer savings. Xave does this by building an Forex (FX) accurate AMM via a custom “FXPool” now and eventually a stablecoin lending market that shares liquidity with the Balancer V2 Vault via a BoostedFXPool.

Xave aims to disrupt existing FX services available for overseas money transfers by releasing the FXPool (and soon to come BoostedFXPool), a custom pool built on the Balancer V2 Vault, that enables instant stablecoin trades at FX accurate rates for traders and extremely competitive returns for LPs (especially with our incoming BoostedFXPool). If done correctly, these fee generating activities will increase yield for LPs.

Xave has three products:
- [FX AMM](https://app.xave.co/#/xave)
- [Lending Market](https://app.lending.xave.co/)
- Xave Strategies (coming soon)

## How it uses Balancer protocol

Xave Finance has built a custom FX AMM on Balancer V2 that focuses on optimized swaps for different stablecoins, while still setting programmatic thresholds that allow the pool’s ratios to snap back to ideal ranges to keep the pool healthy.
