## About

Xave Finance  (pronounced “Save Finance”) allows financial services companies (“fintechs”) to leverage DeFi for real time remittance transfers and high yield consumer savings. Xave does this in a capital efficient way by building an FX accurate AMM and stablecoin lending market that shares liquidity with the Balancer V2 Vault.

Xave aims to disrupt existing FX services available for overseas money transfers by releasing the FXPool (and soon to come BoostedFXPool), a custom pool built on the Balancer V2 Vault (see recap), that enables instant stablecoin trades at FX accurate rates for traders and extremely competitive returns for LPs (especially with our incoming BoostedFXPool). If done correctly, these fee generating activities will increase yield for LPs.

Xave has three products:
- [FX AMM](https://app.xave.co/#/xave)
- [Lending Market](https://app.lending.xave.co/)
- Xave Strategies (coming soon)

## How it uses Balancer protocol

Xave Finance is building a custom AMM on Balancer V2 focusing on optimised swaps for different stablecoins, while still setting programmatic thresholds that allow the pool’s ratios to snap back to ideal ranges to keep the pool healthy.
